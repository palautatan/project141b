# White House Petitions and Bills
We have two overall goals (1) of comparing language between petitions and bills to determine if changes in government reflect We the People and (2) classify liberal from conservative petitions.

## We the People

The right to petition, guaranteed by the First Ammendment, is supported by the We the People platform. Those who wish to petition the government for change may do so by creating a petition online through We The People. If the online petition reaches 100,000 signatures in 30 days, then the petition is to be reviewed by the White House for response.

## The Dataset
Source: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/developers

Using the We the People API, we were able to extract petition data for 100 petitions. The information we retrieved includes:
(1) the petition ID, (2) date created, (3) deadline date, (4) petition title, (5) issues addressed, (6) petition type, (7) signature count, (8) the petition itself, and (9) the URL to the petition.
